C++ Project 2
Overall Objective: Create program that can create Rooms, add events to rooms, 
print the room data, and trim the amount of events.
This is different from the first part of the project for multiple reasons:
* Rooms are held in a linked list of Room nodes
* There is no set buffer for events
* Events exist as event nodes in a dynamically allocated linked list of event 
nodes

==================================================================================
LEVEL 1: READ, LOG, AND PRINT SENSOR DATA FROM ONE ROOM WITHOUT TRIMMING
Functions to complete in Level 1 (x implies completed):
HomeSecurity.cpp:
* HomeEvent: x
	* Constructor x
		* timeStamp x
		* eventId x 
		* sensorId x
		* sensorValue x
	* GetTime x 
	* GetEventId x
	* GetSensorId x 
	* GetSensorValue x
	* SetData x
	* Print x
* Temperature Event, COEvent, IntruderEvent x
	*Constructor (same as HomeEvent) (auto) x
	* SetData x 
	* Print x 
* EventNode 
	* Constructor x 
		* pNextNode (singly linked list) x 
		* pEvent x 
	* Destructor (not sure how to make, may save for later stage of 
	  development)
* EventList
	* Constructor x 
		* pEvents x 
		* totalEvents x 
	* Destructor (not sure how to make, may save for later stage of 
	  development)
	* AddEvent x 
	* GetEventCount x 
	* PrintEvents x 
	* Maybe PrintList {?} (done prior, do not need to touch) x 
Room.cpp:
* Room:
	* Constructor x
		* eventList x
		* roomId x 
	* LoadData x 
	* PrintEvents x 
	* GetRoomId x 
	* AddEvent x 
	* SetRoomId (added function, used in RoomList->AddRoom x 
* RoomNode
	* Constructor x 
		* pNextNode (singlyLinked) x 
		* pRoom x

LEVEL 2: READ, LOG, AND PRINT SENSOR DATA FROM MULTIPLE ROOMS WITHOUT TRIMMING
Already completed in level 1 (nice).
